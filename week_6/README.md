Week 3: Classes and Advanced Algorithms
-------------------------

### By the end of week 3, you should be able to:
- [ ] Combine classes, methods, loops, and recursion to solve challenges
- [ ] Break down problems and manipulate data within data structures  
- [ ] Use multiple methods within classes to solve problems
- [ ] Implement solutions based on mathematical algorithms

### Assignments and Challenges:
*For each challenge:*

1. Formulate pseudocode before solving the problem (include it as a comment).  
2. Refactor each solution so the names are clear and the code is concise and D.R.Y. (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). Ensure your code still passes the RSpec tests by resubmitting it with your changes.  
3. Reflect on your process and understanding (see section below). Include your reflection as comments in your solution.  
4. Complete the [Unit Reflection Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vNru5aR3a3lWOZ9MoUzfgqe-ud1nBPvkIkfUAXG3FhI/viewform) by Sunday at 11:59pm.
