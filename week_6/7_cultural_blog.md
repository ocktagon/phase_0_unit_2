## Learning Objectives

## Directions

First, create a new HTML file for your this post in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week6_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`. 

Conduct some research on strategies for dealing with conflict. You can include some conflict resolution, but also focus on learning how to identify the source of the conflict. 

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file: 

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? 
2. How did you handle that conflict? What did you do?
3. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
4. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?

# U2, W6: Stereotype Threat

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the symptoms and consequences of stereotype threat
- Create strategies for combating stereotype threat

## Directions

Create a new HTML file in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Name it `week6_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`. 

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? 

#### Example Resources:
- [Whistling Vivaldi (book)](http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/0393339726) - If you have quite a bit of time
- [Identity and Stereotype Threat (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk) - Start at 7:30
- [What is Stereotype Threat?](http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html)
- [The Stereotype Threat to Workplace Diversity](http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/)
- [Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/)

In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?

Go into as much depth feels comfortable for you.
